# Sum-by-reursion-Towers-of-Hanoi
recursion.c. In this file write a simple program that will use a recursive function to compute the sum of the squares of all integers from 1 to max inclusive, where max > 1. 
toh.c. Following the pseudocode given in the lecture slides, code up a solution for the “Towers of Hanoi”. Define a variable N in your main function which will represent the number of disks you are solving for.
